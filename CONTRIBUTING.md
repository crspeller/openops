# Code Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We’re glad ❤️ you’re here!

Please read the guidelines below to learn the process for making code contributions.

1. Fork the [OpenOps repository](https://github.com/mattermost/openops), clone it locally, and follow the [installation steps](https://github.com/mattermost/openops#install-openops-mattermost--mattermost-plugin-ai) to build it.
2. Find [help wanted tickets that are up for grabs in GitHub](https://github.com/mattermost/openops/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Up+for+grabs%22+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22). Comment to let everyone know you’re working on it and let a core contributor assign the issue to you. If there’s no ticket for what you want to work on, read about [contributions without a ticket](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/more-info/getting-started/contributions-without-ticket/).
3. When your changes are checked in to your fork, ensure the following is completed:

  - If this will be your first contribution, there is a standard CLA ([Contributor License Agreement](https://mattermost.com/mattermost-contributor-agreement/)) that you will need to sign.
  - Your code is thoroughly tested, including test steps or expected results.
  - The PR title begins with the GitHub issue ID (e.g. [GH-394]) and summary template is filled out.
  - Your PR includes basic documentation about the change/addition you’re submitting

4. Submit your pull request for a [code review](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/more-info/getting-started/code-review/#if-you-are-a-community-member-seeking-a-review) and [wait](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/more-info/getting-started/code-review/#if-you-are-awaiting-a-review) for a core committer to review it. If you get stuck, please message Christopher Speller (@crspeller on GitHub) or Jason Blais (@jasonblais on your GitHub PR).

Good luck and have fun! ❤️
