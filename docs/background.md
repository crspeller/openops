# Background

Every organization is in a race to deploy generative AI solutions, but need to do so in a responsible and safe way. OpenOps lets you run powerful models in a safe sandbox to establish the right safety protocols before rolling out to more users.

- Enables AI exploration with full data control in a multi-user pilot.
- Supports broad ecosystem of AI models from OpenAI and Microsoft to open source LLMs from Hugging Face.
- Speeds development of custom security, compliance and data custody policy from early evaluation to future scale.

Unliked closed source, vendor-controlled environments where data controls cannot be audited, OpenOps provides a transparent, open source, customer-controlled platform for developing, securing and auditing AI-accelerated workflows.

Here's an example of an evaluation, implementation, and iterative rollout process:

- **Phase 1:** Deploy the OpenOps collaboration sandbox.
- **Phase 2:** Evaluate AI-powered workflows and LLM providers based on your security and privacy requirements.
- **Phase 3:** Select early adopters to explore and evaluate the workflows. Observe behavior, record user feedback, and identify issues. Iterate on workflows and usage policies together in the sandbox. Consider issues such as data leakage, legal and copyright protections, privacy, response accuracy, and domain-specific language as you apply AI at scale.
- **Phase 4:** Implement usage policies based on usage evidence and deploy to the wider organization.
